# Hello World in MATLAB

A minimal "Hello, World!" implementation in MATLAB. MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) is a numerical computing environment and programming language. It is widely used in academia and industry for machine learning, signal processing, image processing, control systems, computational biology, and many other fields where numerical computation and data analysis are essential.

## Installation

MATLAB is proprietary software available from MathWorks. There are several installation options:

1. Individual License: Purchase and download from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com)
2. Academic License: Available through many educational institutions
3. Trial Version: 30-day trial available from MathWorks website

### Alternative: GNU Octave
GNU Octave is an open-source alternative that is largely compatible with MATLAB syntax:

macOS:
```bash
brew install octave
```

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install octave
```

## Running

In MATLAB:
1. Start MATLAB
2. Navigate to the directory containing hello.m
3. Type in the command window:
```matlab
hello
```

Using GNU Octave from command line:
```bash
octave hello.m
```

## Code Explanation

The program demonstrates several MATLAB fundamentals. MATLAB functions are defined using the `function` keyword and must be saved in a file with the same name as the function (in this case, `hello.m`). The `disp` function is used for displaying output. MATLAB uses single quotes for string literals, which are more efficient than double quotes as they don't process escape sequences.

MATLAB's heritage as a matrix manipulation language means that even simple programs follow certain conventions. For instance, the `.m` extension comes from MATLAB's original focus on matrix mathematics, and the function declaration style reflects MATLAB's roots in numerical computing where functions typically operate on matrices.
